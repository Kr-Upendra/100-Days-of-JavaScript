# Save Any Information

- It is a simple project using <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS</b>.
- I have used LocalStorage to save information.
- UI isn't that good but its functionallity is working as I wanted.

Here are some sample images..

![Third](</Save%20Any%20Info/img/Screenshot%20(98).png>)
![Fourth](</Save%20Any%20Info/img/Screenshot%20(99).png>)
